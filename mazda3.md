### What car do I want?
  After doing research, going between toyota, honda, and mazda, I decided on mazda. 
  Why? They sound the most fun to drive, and I like the look of them better.The model I want is mazda3, 
  the compact sedan model for mazda.  The mpg is still good, the price range is the same, and they are 
  supposed to be pretty reliable as well. 
 
### What monthly payment can I afford?
   Edmunds says you should be paying 15% of your total salary max on a car (insurance + gas + car payment). 
   - Monthly post-tax income: 2292 *.15 = 344
   - Gas: I would save ~$40/month on gas compared to the taurus ($160 -> $120).
   - Insurance: $140

```
344 - 140- 120 = 83.8 (monthly car payment)
```

### How much car can I afford? 
The next step is to figure out what is the max true market value(TMV) I can afford. 
- According to mint and creditkarma, my credit score is 733
- I want this car payment for 48 months max. 
- My cash down payment I could provide next friday would be $1000. 
- Taurus trade-in: My guess is $100 given the problems.

Plugging all of these factors into the edmunds affordability calculator, with 4% APR for loan
I get $4,500 as the max TMV, with a sticker price range of 3,000 to 6,000.

### Why I am going to go higher than this advice

Given that my rent is low, I would like to go above this number a little bit, and go for a ~2010-2013 mazda3.According to edmunds, the TMV of a 2010 mazda3 with midrange trim is 5,166. Not terribly above my goal. Sticker prices I've seen generally are between 6,000 to 7,000. If I allow myself to take 17% of monthly income vs 15%, this gives me $130/mo allowance to spend on car payment. Lastly, I think it could save myself money long term to buy a newer, lower mileage car that may need less repairs.

### My plan
1. Get preapproved for a loan. I want to apply with at least one bank and one credit union to try to get the best loan.
2. Find who I want to buy from. I would like to buy from a franchised dealer if possible. 
3. Make an appointment with a dealership, one day before. Make sure the car will be there, it is ready and not going through work.
